# **Vehicle Speed Detection using Machine Learning**

Vehicle speed detection is a fascinating application of Machine Learning and Python that can contribute to various fields, such as traffic management, law enforcement, and road safety. The project aims to develop a system that can automatically estimate the speed of vehicles from video footage or image sequences captured by cameras placed alongside roads or highways, counts the car, detects color of the cars and alert if speed exceeds then alert user and traffic management.
