E-Kars is a (hypothetical) e-Commerce project that sells used electric cars. Features include full user authentication (register, login, and forgotpassword with Nodemailer), Stripe payment system, and Redux for state management.

On the products page, you can place multiple filters with the sidebar on the left. Using Redux was extremely useful in order to pass multiple levels of state between each React component.

I created a custom form using Stripe for check out. However, to get to this page, you must be logged in first. See below to use my test account!

Feel free to browse with the intention of buying a few cars. Upon proceeding to checkout, you will be asked to login before being allowed to proceed with the purchase.
You can use my ID & PW for testing. However, if you want to see what the "forgot password" workflow is like, you can register your own email, or refer to the gif below!
